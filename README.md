# FULL MERN STACK APPLICATION

A fully functional crud application built with React, Express, Mongoose. 

> The frontend is a single page application built with react, while the backend is built as a restful service using node Express server

## TODO : Covert the client to use next.js for server side rendering

Contributions are welcomed though this is a dummy project

> NOTE: Ensure you have mongodb setup locally on your machine else you can change the connection string to use any mongodb server.
